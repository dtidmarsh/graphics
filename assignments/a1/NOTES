Makefile provided for easy compilation under
Linux - just type 'make'.

Passes all 4 test cases provided and runs without
errors under Valgrind/Memcheck.

I wanted to make my code fairly robust, so I
rigorously checked the input of the scene and
.raw files. Initially a malformed instruction
within a file would result in program termination,
but I had to change this, as scene 3 (teapot)
contained an incorrect line at the very end of
the .raw file that resulted in failure without
rendering the triangles. Now a malformed
instruction will be simply skipped (with user
notification through stderr) and the remaining
information will still go into the render;
premature termination occurs only when the program
cannot read the provided scene file or its header
contents (width, height, minimum/maximum X & Y
coordinates).
